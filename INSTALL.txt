Your INSTALL.txt file should provide the detailed steps required to compile your source code. For instance, “go and download and install SomeThirdParty library” is not an acceptable instruction. Instead, provide the exact commands and URLs needed to install other libraries that are needed to compile and use your source code.

# Dataset
We used a subset of the ArXiv dataset from Kaggle which contains 12,926 samples, and the the pickle file is provided at "beyond_vector_search/data/filtered_data.pickle". 

# Installation
We used Python==3.9.18, and we recommend using a virtual environment to install the required packages. 
```
cd beyond_vector_search
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/Activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
